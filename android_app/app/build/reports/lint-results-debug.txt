E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:7: Warning: READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should instead use one or more new storage permissions: READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO or READ_MEDIA_AUDIO. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:8: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to write to shared storage, use the MediaStore.createWriteRequest intent. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media
   files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new
   storage permissions:
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

   and then add maxSdkVersion="33" to the older permission. See the developer
   guide for how to do this:
   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granula
   r-media-permissions

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\build.gradle:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:30: Warning: Expecting android:screenOrientation="unspecified" or "fullSensor" for this activity so the user can use the application in any orientation and provide a great experience on Chrome OS devices [LockedOrientationActivity]
            android:screenOrientation="portrait"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LockedOrientationActivity":
   The <activity> element should not be locked to any orientation so that
   users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger
   screens available on Android. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding activity element with `screenOrientation="unspecified"or
   "fullSensor"` attribute.

    <color name="white">#FFFFFFFF</color>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\res\drawable\ic_launcher.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/ic_launcher.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:27: Warning: Missing contentDescription attribute on image [ContentDescription]
        <ImageView
         ~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to
   @null. If your app's minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set
   these graphical elements' android:importantForAccessibility attributes to
   no.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.

E:\JFT\Irodori apps - Copy\android_app\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:42: Warning: Hardcoded string "Welcome to IrodoriAI", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
            android:text="Welcome to IrodoriAI"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
